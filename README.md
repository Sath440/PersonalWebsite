About Me — Static Site

This is a small, responsive "About Me" static website scaffold you can customize.

Files created
- `index.html` — main page with Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Contact
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — tiny interactions (current year, demo contact form)

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).
2. Replace placeholder texts: your name, tagline, about paragraph, skills, experience items, and email in the contact section.
3. Place your resume PDF in this folder and rename it to `resume.pdf` to enable the "Download Resume" button.
4. Optionally add `profile.jpg` in the same folder and update the `.photo` markup if you want a real photo.

Notes
- The contact form is client-side only. To receive messages, wire the form to a backend or use a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- If you'd like, I can populate the content from your attached resume PDF. Tell me if you want that and which sections to extract.

Next steps I can do for you
- Pull content from your PDF and auto-fill the page.
- Add a simple deployment setup (GitHub Pages or Netlify).
- Convert to a single-file resume page suitable for sharing (print styles).
